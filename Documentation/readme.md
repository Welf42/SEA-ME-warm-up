### Libraries
- [Detailed Documentation to Qt classes](qt.md)

#### Core Qt Classes
- **QMainWindow**: 
  - Idea: Think of this as the skeleton of your application's main window.
  - Use case: Create a window with a menu bar, toolbars, and a status bar.

- **QDialog**: 
  - Idea: A pop-up window for short-term tasks and brief communications with the user.
  - Use case: Create a settings window or a "About" information box.

- **QWidget**: 
  - Idea: The basic building block for user interface objects.
  - Use case: Create custom UI elements or containers for other widgets.

- **QObject**: 
  - Idea: The heart of Qt's meta-object system.
  - Use case: Enable features like signals and slots for communication between objects.

#### GUI Components
- **QListView**: 
  - Idea: A scrollable list of items.
  - Use case: Display a list of files, contacts, or any collection of items.

- **QTextBrowser**: 
  - Idea: A widget to display and navigate rich text documents.
  - Use case: Show formatted help text or a simple web browser.

- **QLineEdit**: 
  - Idea: A one-line text input field.
  - Use case: Get user input for names, search queries, or simple data entry.

- **QPushButton**: 
  - Idea: A clickable button with text or an icon.
  - Use case: Create action buttons like "Save", "Cancel", or "Submit".

- **QLabel**: 
  - Idea: A widget to display text or images.
  - Use case: Show static text, status messages, or small images in your UI.

#### Models and Data
- **QStandardItemModel**: 
  - Idea: A generic model for storing custom data.
  - Use case: Manage data for tree views or tables with custom information.

- **QStandardItem**: 
  - Idea: An item for use with QStandardItemModel.
  - Use case: Represent a single cell or node in your data model.

- **QModelIndex**: 
  - Idea: A "pointer" to a specific piece of data in a model.
  - Use case: Access or modify data within a model structure.

#### Layouts
- **QVBoxLayout**: 
  - Idea: Arranges widgets vertically in a single column.
  - Use case: Stack buttons or form elements vertically.

- **QFormLayout**: 
  - Idea: Manages pairs of widgets, usually labels and input fields.
  - Use case: Create forms with labeled inputs, like registration or settings pages.

#### Dialogs and Messaging
- **QInputDialog**: 
  - Idea: A simple dialog to get a single piece of information from the user.
  - Use case: Prompt for a user's name or a single value.

- **QMessageBox**: 
  - Idea: A dialog for showing messages and getting simple responses.
  - Use case: Show error messages, warnings, or ask yes/no questions.

#### Other Qt Classes
- **QIcon**: 
  - Idea: Represents a graphical icon.
  - Use case: Add icons to buttons, menu items, or window titles.

- **QPixmap**: 
  - Idea: Represents an image in memory.
  - Use case: Load and display images in your application.

- **QDialogButtonBox**: 
  - Idea: A group of buttons following the platform's style guidelines.
  - Use case: Add standard buttons (OK, Cancel, Apply) to dialogs consistently.

- **QString**: 
  - Idea: Qt's own string class, designed for easy text manipulation.
  - Use case: Handle text throughout your Qt application.

- **QList**: 
  - Idea: A template class that provides a list data structure.
  - Use case: Store and manipulate collections of items or data.

<summary><h2>C++</h2></summary>

Certainly! I'll expand on these sections with additional chapters and provide summaries for each point:

### Libraries
1. **Standard Template Library (STL)**
   - Summary: The STL is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures.

2. **Boost**
   - Summary: Boost is a set of libraries for the C++ programming language that provide support for tasks and structures such as linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation, multithreading, image processing, regular expressions, and unit testing.

3. **Qt**
   - Summary: Qt is a widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms.

4. **OpenCV**
   - Summary: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, widely used for image processing, video capture and analysis, object detection, and more.

### Syntax
#### Classes
##### Private, Protected, Public
- Summary: Access modifiers in C++ control the visibility and accessibility of class members.
  - Private: Accessible only within the class.
  - Protected: Accessible within the class and its derived classes.
  - Public: Accessible from anywhere in the program.

#### Constructors and Destructors
- Summary: Special member functions in C++ classes. Constructors initialize objects, while destructors clean up resources when objects are destroyed.

#### Virtual Functions
- Summary: Functions declared in a base class that can be overridden in derived classes, enabling runtime polymorphism.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
#### Inheritance
- Summary: Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship between classes.

#### Encapsulation
- Summary: Bundles data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or object, hiding internal details and protecting data from unauthorized access.

#### Polymorphism
- Summary: Allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base class, enabling more flexible and extensible code.

#### Abstraction
- Summary: Simplifies complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors, hiding unnecessary details from the user.

### Advanced C++ Concepts
#### Templates
- Summary: Enable writing generic code that works with any data type, promoting code reusability and type safety.

#### Exception Handling
- Summary: Provides a way to handle runtime errors and exceptional situations, improving program robustness and error management.

#### Smart Pointers
- Summary: Objects that act like pointers but provide additional features such as automatic memory management, helping prevent memory leaks and other common pointer-related issues.

#### Lambda Expressions
- Summary: Allow the creation of anonymous function objects, providing a concise way to write inline functions.

#### Move Semantics
- Summary: Enables the efficient transfer of resources from one object to another, optimizing performance in certain scenarios.

These expanded sections provide a more comprehensive overview of important C++ concepts and libraries, offering a solid foundation for understanding and working with the language.

### Pictures
To include images in Markdown documentation, use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](URL/path to image)

Example:
![Qt Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Qt_logo_2016.svg)
```

### Tables
To create tables in Markdown, use the following syntax:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |

Example:
| Language | Creator | Year |
|----------|---------|------|
| C++ | Bjarne Stroustrup | 1979 |
| Qt | Trolltech | 1995 |
```

### Collapsed Section
To create collapsed sections in Markdown (works on GitHub):

```markdown

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

This content is hidden by default.
You can add any Markdown-formatted content here.

```

### Code Blocks
To include code blocks in Markdown, use triple backticks (```) before and after your code:

```markdown
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
